# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  # This section identifies this Flutter project as a plugin project.
  # The androidPackage and pluginClass identifiers should not ordinarily
  # be modified. They are used by the tooling to maintain consistency when
  # adding or updating assets for this project.
  plugin:
    androidPackage: com.dexbytes.firebase_chat
    pluginClass: FirebaseChatPlugin

  # To add assets to your plugin package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - packages/firebase_chat/assets/images/Back1.png
    - packages/firebase_chat/assets/images/attachment@3x.png
    - packages/firebase_chat/assets/images/send1@2x.png
    - packages/firebase_chat/assets/images/camera.png
    - packages/firebase_chat/assets/images/dot@3x.png
    - packages/firebase_chat/assets/images/dot_menu.png
    - packages/firebase_chat/assets/images/add_border@3x.png
    - packages/firebase_chat/assets/images/check_pink@3x.png
    - packages/firebase_chat/assets/images/info@3x.png
    - packages/firebase_chat/assets/images/search@3x.png
#    - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # To add custom fonts to your plugin package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Gelion
      fonts:
        - asset: packages/firebase_chat/assets/Gelion-Regular.ttf
        - asset: packages/firebase_chat/assets/Gelion-Medium.ttf
        - asset: packages/firebase_chat/assets/Gelion-SemiBold.ttf
        - asset: packages/firebase_chat/assets/Precious.ttf

  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
